Great song but @cokestudio what support are you providing the singers of this song? Particularly Abdul Wahab Bugti whose family has been left homeless after severe flooding in his town? <br><br>Surely you can support folk artists you work with the same way you support QB/Ali Sethi/Urooj Aftab? Your silence around this is deafening ðŸ¤®,mrj,5
